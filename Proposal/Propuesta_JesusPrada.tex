\section{Introduction}

%Introducción a la propuesta de Monografía. Debe incluir un breve resumen del estado del arte del problema a tratar. También deben aparecer citadas todas las referencias de la bibliografía (a menos de que se citen más adelante, en los objetivos o metodología, por ejemplo)

A complete physical picture of Dark Matter (DM) is still missing.
This is one of the biggest puzzles to fully understand the composition of our Universe.
So far, its presence can only be measured through its gravitational effect on the surrounding visible matter. 
One of best the astronomical systems that can be used to probe DM in astronomical scales is our own galaxy: the Milky Way (MW).
Probing the DM density field around our galaxy (it's so-called DM halo) can shed light on the nature of DM [referencias] and our galaxy's formation history [referencias].

One of the most basic features that can be measured in the MW DM halo is its shape. 
Different observational methods have been developed to constrain it. 
They range from the use of Jean's equations \cite{Loebman et al. 2012} to the satellite systems such as the Sagittarius stream and the Large Magellanic Cloud \cite{Vera-Ciro et al  2013, Deg & Widrow 2012, Law & Majewski 2010}. 
However, different assumptions are made in these studies, producing widely different results.
Thus, constraining the density field of the DM halo of the Milky Way remains an open research topic in present-day astronomy. 

Today, computational astrophysics can support all these observationally projects by helping to prove (or disprove) the range of validity of different assumptios. [referencias].
Simulations can also serve to find priors on the expected MW DM halo shape.
However, using simulations comes at a cost.
First, different degrees of realism in the implemented physical models should yield different results.
Second, artifacts can appear due to the always limited numerical resolution. 
For these reasons, the study of simulations of astronomical or cosmological systems, as well as the research for reducing the aforementioned biases of computation, is an important field of study in modern astrophysics.\\

Recently, with the growth of computational power and the improvement of numerical models, the performance and further study of realistic simulations which trace the non-linear interactions of DM and baryonic components has been possible. These simulations can reproduce important features of our observable universe in a wide range of scales, from the cosmic star formation rate density and galaxy luminosity function in cosmological simulations to more specific features of Milky way type galaxies such as their stellar masses, rotation curves, star formation rates and metallicities. In these observations, the freedom in measurements and the control over the state of the systems and its observables, constitute the biggest advantages over observational astronomy.\\

In this context, the analysis of realistic simulations of Milky way-like galaxies, which has only been possible until very recently \cite{aquarius}, is of great importance to complement and perhaps give clues about details to have into account when probing the DM density field in observations regarding our galaxy. However, realistically reproducing the features of our Milky way galaxy is not an easy task. It requires producing the correct initial conditions and not only having a sophisticated full-physics model to reproduce observables and a powerful computer, but to very carefully tune the free parameters of these models such as the ones associated to the many dissipation and feedback processes of baryonic matter to produce observables which are comparable to the observational data. This is why, before the arrival of realistic Milky way-like simulations such as Aquarius \cite{aquarius}, there was a generation of DM-only simulations which used the final state of the evolution of DM to reproduce, via semi-analytical models, the statistical features of the observable universe. These type of simulations have substantial information to work with, but may be biased in aspects regarding the historical relation between DM and baryonic matter, which is related to the question of our galaxy's DM density field \cite{relation DM baryons is important}. The task of incorporating baryonic matter in these simulations is in fact so difficult that, even with the most correct prescriptions of that date, Aquarius is a recent set of just six Milky way-like galaxies, which can make any study performed on it of low statistical significance.\\

More recently, with the deveolpment of the latest and most accurate hydrodynamical code AREPO \cite{arepo} and the improvements of the physical numerial models regarding baryons, it has been possible the simulation of thirty Milky way-like galaxies in the project AURIGA \cite{auriga}. This code AREPO reconciles the advantages and solves the flaws of the two paradigms of cosmology-oriented numerical hydrodynamics models namely Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian hydrodynamics with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR). Furthermore, it can simulate magnetic fields, which is a novel feature in this type of simulations. Therefore, it becomes clear that the study of the DM density field on these simulations may produce a more complete insight when performed on these simulations due to the statistical significance of the sample which is also strong evidence of the big improvements of the baryonic state-of-the-art physics models.\\

In this order of ideas, the principal objective of this monograph is to use the results of the pioneering AURIGA project \cite{AURIGA} to study the halo density field of these thirty galaxies obtaining statistically significant results which can then be compared to the state-of-the-art observations. Specifically, we will focus on the shape of the DM halo in function of its radius and its history, according to the guidelines stablished in a previous and similar study over the Aquarius simulations by Vera-Ciro et al. \cite{Vera-Ciro et al 2011}. The performance of this research on the AURIGA simulations is highly motivated by the fact that studies of the DM density field like this have not been carried out on this nouvelle project AURIGA. Hopefully, with this study we can elucidate some aspects about the history and relation of baryonic matter and DM in Milky way-like galaxies, which can then be extrapolated to the observational field of study, contributing in this way with our grain of sand in the transcendental enigma that represents DM to modern physics.\\


\section{General objectives}

\section{Methodology}

%Exponer DETALLADAMENTE la metodología que se usará en la Monografía. 

%Monografía teórica o computacional: ¿Cómo se harán los cálculos teóricos? ¿Cómo se harán las simulaciones? ¿Qué requerimientos computacionales se necesitan? ¿Qué espacios físicos o virtuales se van a utilizar?

%Monografía experimental: Recordar que para ser aprobada, los aparatos e insumos experimentales que se usarán en la Monografía deben estar previamente disponibles en la Universidad, o garantizar su disponibilidad para el tiempo en el que se realizará la misma. ¿Qué montajes experimentales se van a usar y que material se requiere? ¿En qué espacio físico se llevarán a cabo los experimentos? Si se usan aparatos externos, ¿qué permisos se necesitan? Si hay que realizar pagos a terceros, ¿cómo se financiará esto?

The student will perform the mentioned research individually with the periodic (weekly) support of his advisors through in-person meetings in the Astrophysics group when possible or electronic message interchange otherwise. In these meetings the student will obtain feedback about his work development and it will be decided if more time is necessary to discuss the partial results of this thesis. The student has visited  the Heidelberg's Institute of Theoretical Studies (HITS) where he worked for one month as an invited scientist sponsored by the Latinamerican Chinese European Galaxy Formation Network (LACEGAL) \cite{LACEGAL}. Specifically, the student worked with the Theoretical Astrophysics (TAP) group which was under the leadership of Volker Springel. It was there where the main ideas of this project were born. Some other visits to HITS are planned during the course of this monograph with the objective of obtaining in-person feedback from the co-advisor. These visits will also be fully funded by the LACEGAL project.\\

The proposed methodology has a strong computational component related to the analysis of high resolution galaxy simulations. The student has access, from his previously mentioned visit, to the computational cluster at HITS where the information of these simulations reside. He will at most need access to the Uniandes computational cluster. Furthermore, the revision of specialized bibliography is indispensable.\\
